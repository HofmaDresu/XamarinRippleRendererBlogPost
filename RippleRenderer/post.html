    <h1>Creating a custom button with ripple effect in Xamarin Forms</h1>
    <p>Xamarin Forms is very powerful system and allows for a lot of customization out of the box.
        However, sometimes you need to go beyond the default controls and build something custom. I recently
        ran into this when I needed to build a multi-line custom button similiar to <img src="" alt="Multi line button" />.
        The Button control in Xamarin Forms only allows a single line of text and doesn't provide a way
        to customize the button's layout. You could create a custom control within Forms using a StackLayout and
        a TapGestureRecognizer, but you would loose responsize behaviors like color changes on iOS and the ripple
        effect on Android. This is where custom renderers come in.

    <p>
        Xamarin provides documentation on how to create a custom renderer in several situations <href a="" target="_blank">here</href>
        which will get you through many situations but there isn't anythign specific to custom buttons, so I thought
        I'd write down what I did to create this effect. All of the code for this post is available on <href a="" target="_blank">GitHub</href>
        with tags for each step of the process. If you want to follow along, start with the tag "initial-view-model"
